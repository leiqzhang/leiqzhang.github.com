================================
Support volume backup for qcow2
================================

https://blueprints.launchpad.net/cinder/+spec/support-volume-backup-for-qcow2

Currently, cinder-backup doesn't support qcow2 format disk. Add the support
for it will make drivers which use qcow2 as volume, such as glusterfs etc,
work together with cinder-backup, and can also make nfs driver use qcow2 as
volume be possible.

Problem description
===================

Currently, cinder-backup doesn't support qcow2 format disk because the backup
code assumes the source volume is a raw volume. The destination (i.e. swift,
rbd) should absolutely remain universal across all volume back-ends.

Proposed change
===============

* Add qemu-nbd support to cinder-backup. Qemu-nbd can mount qcow2 volume as
  a raw device to the host
* The default cinder.volume.driver.VolumeDriver:backup_volume method will
  mount qcow2 volume as nbd device before call backup_service's backup method
