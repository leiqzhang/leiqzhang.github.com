================================
Support volume backend for qcow2
================================

https://blueprints.launchpad.net/cinder/+spec/support-volume-backup-for-qcow2

Currently, cinder-backup doesn't support qcow2 format disk. Add the support
for it will make drivers which use qcow2 as volume, such as glusterfs etc,
work together with cinder-backup, and can also make nfs driver use qcow2 as
volume be possible.

Problem description
===================

Currently, cinder-backup doesn't support qcow2 format disk because the backup
code assumes the source volume is a raw volume. The destination (i.e. swift,
rbd) should absolutely remain universal across all volume back-ends.
